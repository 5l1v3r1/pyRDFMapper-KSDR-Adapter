This script uploads bearings generated by the KerberosSDR to a RDFMapper bearing server. By default it uploads to the public server at http://rdf.musther.net/save.php. You can use the RDF Mapper software created by Jonathan Musther at http://www.musther.net/RDFMapper/ to view the bearings from various servers on a map.

------INSTALL AND USE------

First to make sure Python and pip installed on system.

1. Run this command first `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the pre-requisites.

2. Open `nano .env` and add the IP address of the KerberosSDR server.
 a) Add a UNIQUE station ID
 b) Set your LAT/LON 
 c) Set the bearing of your KerberosSDR, with 0 being NORTH, 90 being EAST, 180 being SOUTH, and 270 being WEST. So for example if antenna 1 on your circular array points SOUTH, set KSDR_BEARING = 180.
 d) POLLING_INTERVAL sets how often you want to poll the KerberosSDR bearing server and upload to the RDFMapper server. LINE_LENGTH determines how long the bearing line will be on the RDFMapper display.
 
3. Run the main script `python3 rdf_mapper.py`
